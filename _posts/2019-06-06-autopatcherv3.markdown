AutopatcherV3. Summer project
I use a script (well collections of scripts) to help patch large collections of ESXi hosts. Autopatcher helps orchestrate both the firmware and actual remediation. This time with Autopatcher i was helping to jazz up the interface a bit and make it look a bit more professional.
