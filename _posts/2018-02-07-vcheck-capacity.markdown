Custom vCheck Reporting. Spring project
Those of you that have to support VMware based have probably come across tools like vCheck or RVTools. I like the interface of vCheck and how you easily get it to run new powershell scripts to check particular things. I already have various scripts to check capacity and wanted to see if i could group them together under vCheck, and get the great interface at the same time.
