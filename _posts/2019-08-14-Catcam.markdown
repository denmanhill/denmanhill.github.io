CATCAM Summer project
This summer i wanted to start a new project to learn some python skills and had the idea of something that might engage my kids a bit more. The idea of catcam was born. There are a few main components that we wanted to build:

* A remote controlled lego car
* Ability to attach a webcam and watch where the car is going
* To access the controls and webcam via a webpage
* Write any underlying code in python rather then powershell.
